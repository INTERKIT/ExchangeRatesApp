## Overview
The app must download and update rates every 1 second using the API https://revolut.duckdns.org/latest?base=EUR.
List all currencies you get from the endpoint (one per row). Each row has an input where you can enter any amount of money. When you tap on a currency row, it should slide to the top and its input becomes the first responder. When youâ€™re changing the amount, the app must simultaneously update the corresponding value for other currencies.

The app follows MVP principles. The Presenter handles the logic of downloading and updating rates from the API every second. It updates the View with the new data, ensuring that the View displays the list of currencies and handles user interactions. The Model represents the data, and the Presenter interacts with the Model to fetch and update the rates. This architecture separates the concerns, making the codebase easier to manage and test.
